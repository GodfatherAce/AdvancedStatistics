Inverse Transform Sampling

Also known as the Probability Integral Transform.

This is a method of generating sample numbers at random from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution
function.

This method is generally applicable, but may be too computationally intensive in practice for some probability distributions.

\subsection*{Definition}
The probability integral transform states that if X is a Cont.R.V with a strictly increasing CDF $F_x$ and if $Y=F_x(X)$, then
Y has a uniform distribution on [0,1]
