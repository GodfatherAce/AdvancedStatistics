Neyman Allocation

Neyman allocation is a sample allocation method that may be used with stratified samples. The purpose of the method is to maximize survey precision, given a fixed sample size. With Neyman allocation, the "best" sample size for stratum h would be:
nh = n * ( Nh * Sh ) / [ Î£ ( Ni * Si ) ]
where nh is the sample size for stratum h, n is total sample size, Nh is the population size for stratum h, and Sh is the standard deviation of stratum h.
Neyman allocation is actually a special case of optimal allocation .
