Yt=13Yt-1+112Yt-2+t


for a process {Yt}, where {t} is a white noise process.(-t)


(i) Find the roots of the autoregressive characteristic equation and check that the stationarity condition is satisfied.(4)

 

(ii) Find the Yule-Walker equations that are satisfied by the autocorrelation function t.(4)

 

(iii) Obtain the value of 1        (3)

 

(iv) Show that a general expression for the autocorrelation function is given by
=3544(12)+944(-16)where0     (9)
