7. The Holt-Winters forecasting procedure is to be used for a time series with multiplicative seasonal variation of period p.


(i) Let Yt denote the observed value of the series, Lt the local level, Bt the trend and It the seasonal index, all
at time t. If α, γ and δ denote the smoothing constants for Lt, Bt and It respectively, write down the updating equations for Lt, Bt and It. (3)

(ii) Write down an expression for the forecast ˆ yT(h) at time T for lead time h.(2)
