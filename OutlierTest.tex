4) Outlier tests
 
The most common test for outliers is the Grubbs' test . This test is used to detect a single outlier (only one) in a univariate data set that follows an approximately normal distribution.
 
Grubbs' test is defined for the  hypothesis:
 
 Ho:  There are no outliers in the data set          
 Ha:  There is exactly one outlier in the data set  (two-tailed)
 
There are variations of this test to examine whether the minimum value is an outlier, the maximum value is an outlier, or whether there are multiple outliers present.
