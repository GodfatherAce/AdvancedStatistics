Tolerance Intervals 

Loosely speaking, a tolerance interval for a measured quantity is the interval in which there is some "likelihood" (or, of which you feel a some "level of confidence") that a specified fraction of the population's values lie, based on a sample that you measured from this population.


Tolerance intervals have been widely used in statistical process control. This page will calculate tolerance intervals for any specified population fraction, and for any specified level of confidence, from the mean and standard deviation of a finite sample, under the assumption that the population is normally distributed. One-sided (upper and lower) intervals, as well as the two-sided interval, are calculated.
