A data set containing a large number of observed variables can be considered in the context of a number of latent variables that contain the "true" information in the data set.

The true number of latent variables can not easily be determined. Technique such as eigenvalue-one or scree plots can be used to guess. 

Principal components (otherwise known as factors) are used to represent these latent variables. 

 
Variance inflation factor and tolerance tolerance. One is the reciprocal of the other.

1forward selection
2backward elimination
