Data mining is the art and science of intelligent data analysis. By building 

knowledge from information, data mining adds considerable value to the ever 

increasing stores of electronic data that abound today. In performing data 

mining many decisions need to be made regarding the choice of methodology, 

the choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of algorithms.

#### Predictive Model Markup Language 

The Predictive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008) provides 

such a standard language for representing data mining models. PMML

is an XML based standard that is supported, to some extent, by the major 

commercial data mining vendors and many open source data mining tools.
