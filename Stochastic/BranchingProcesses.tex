Branching Processes
The population size at time n will be denoted by Zn.
 
Generation n+1 is made up of the offspring of individuals from generation n.
 
 
The probability of ultimate extinction
 
A central question in the theory of branching processes is the probability of ultimate extinction, where no individuals exist after some finite number of generations. It is not hard to show that, starting with one individual in generation zero, the expected size of generation n equals n where μ is the expected number of children of each individual.
 
If μ is less than 1, then the expected number of individuals goes rapidly to zero, which implies ultimate extinction with probability 1 by Markov's inequality.
 
Alternatively, if μ is greater than 1, then the probability of ultimate extinction is less than 1 (but not necessarily zero; consider a process where each individual either dies without issue or has 100 children with equal probability).
 
If μ is equal to 1, then ultimate extinction occurs with probability 1 unless each individual always has exactly one child.

In a branching process the probability that any individual has j descendants is given by
 
po=0   and  pj=12j+1(j1)


Show that the PGF of the first generation is given by G(s) =12-s

In a branching process the probability that any individual has j descendants is given by
 
po=0   and  pj=12j(j1)


Show that the PGF of the first generation is given by G(s) =s2-s

HW4.2 Example
 
A branching process has the probability generating function
 
G(s) = a + bs + (1 - a-b)s2
 
for the descendants of any individual, where a and b satisfy the inequalities  0 < a < 1;    b > 0;    a + b< 1:
 
 

Given that the process starts with one individual, discuss the nature of the descendant generations. What is the maximum possible population of the n-th generation? Show that extinction in the population is certain if 2a + b1:
 
Solution
 
G(s) = b + 2(1 - a -b)s

G(s) = 2 - 2a - 2b
 
mean =G(1) = b + 2(1 - a -b) = 2-2a -b
 


variance  
    2=G(1) +-2
    2= [2-2a-2b] + [2-2a-b]-[2-2a-b]2
        = [4-4a-3b]- [2(2-2a-b) - 2a(2-2a-b)-b(2-2a-b)]
        = [4-4a-3b]- [(4-4a-2b) +(-4a-4a2+2ab)+(-2b+2ab+b2)]
        = [4-4a-3b]- [4-8a-4b-4a2+4ab +b2)]
        = [4a+b+4a2-4ab -b2]

distribution. Obtain the mean size of the nth generation. Show that ultimate
extinction is certain if λ is less than the computed value 2.065.
