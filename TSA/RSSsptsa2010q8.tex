Let $Y_t$ denote the observed value of a time series at time $t$ and $\hat{y}(h)$ the forecast at time $T$ for lead time $h$.

Holt's two parametr smoothing method is to be used in forecasting.

Let $L_t$ denote the local level and $B_t$ the trend at time $t$.If $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ denote the smoothing constants for $L_t$
and $B_t$ respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\item[a] write down the updating equations for $L_t$ and $B_t$.
\item[b] Write down an expression for $\hat{y}(h)$ 
\end{itemize}
