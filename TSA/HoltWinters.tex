\subsection*{Holt Winters Procedure}

The Holt-Winter forecasting procedure is to be used for time series with multiplicative season variation of period $P$.

Let $Y_t$ denote the observed value of a series at time $t$, $L_t$ is the local level, $B_t$ is the traend and $I_t$ is the seasonal index at time $t$.

If $\alpha$,$\gamma$ and $\delta$ denote the smoothing constants for $L_t$, $B_t$ and $I_t$ respectively, write down the updating quations.

%======================================================%
\subsubsection*{Solution}
The updating equations are as follows

\[ L_t = \alpha(Y_t/I_{}) +(1-\alpha)(L_{t_1} - B_{t_1} )\]

\[ B_t = \gamma(L_{t} - L_{t_1} ) + (1-\gamma)B_{t_1} \]
\[ I_t = \delta (Y_t/L_t) + (1-\delta)I_{t-p}\]
Write down an expression for the forecast $\hat{Y}_t(h)$ at time T for lead time $h$.

\[  \hat{Y}_t(h) = L_t + hB_t (I_{t-p+h}) \]
