Interval estimates for fitted values

The fitted value

ˆ Y for a value x of the explanatory variable is the best estimate of

the mean of the response variable

Y for that value x. It is given by

ˆ

Y = A + Bx.

Root Mean Square Error

The root mean square error (RMSE)) is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed from the thing being modeled or estimated.


Since the RMSE is a good measure of accuracy, it is ideal if it is small.

CI for regression line grows wider as get farther away from the

mean of the predictor.
