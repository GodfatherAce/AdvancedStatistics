Reliability
The Reliability Function R(t), also known as the Survival Function S(t), is defined by:  R(t) = S(t) = the probability a unit survives beyond
time t.
 
Since a unit either fails, or survives, and one of these two mutually exclusive alternatives must occur, we have  R(t) = 1 - F(t),   F(t) = 1 - R(t)

Systems in Series
In this model, the entire system fails if one component fails.  We assume that the failure time distribution for the k-th  component is characterised by k(t).
 
Probability that all components are operating at time t.
 
R*(t) = Pr(T>t) =k=1nRk(t)
Systems in Parallel
This is a system of n components working in parallel. The system only fails when all of the components fail.
 
F*(t) =k=1nFk(t)
This is the probability that the system fails at or the before th, which is the probability that all components fail at or before time t.
