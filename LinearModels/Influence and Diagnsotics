Some important terms in linear regression. 
==========================================
Residual: The difference between the predicted value (based on the regression equation) and the 
actual, observed value. 
Outlier: In linear regression, an outlier is an observation with large residual. In other words, it is an 
observation whose dependent-variable value is unusual given its value on the predictor variables. 
An outlier may indicate a sample peculiarity or may indicate a data entry error or other problem. 
Leverage: An observation with an extreme value on a predictor variable is a point with high 
leverage. Leverage is a measure of how far an independent variable deviates from its mean. High 
leverage points can have a great amount of effect on the estimate of regression coefficients. 
Influence: An observation is said to be influential if removing the observation substantially changes 
the estimate of the regression coefficients. Influence can be thought of as the product of leverage 
and outlierness. 
Cook's distance (or Cook's D): A measure that combines the information of leverage and residual of 
the observation.
