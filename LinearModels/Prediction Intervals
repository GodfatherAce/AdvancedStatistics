Prediction Intervals 
 
In contrast to a confidence interval, which is concerned with estimating a population parameter, a 
prediction interval is concerned with estimating an individual value and is therefore a type of 
probability interval. (Another type of interval we will see later in the course is a Tolerance Interval ) 
 
The complete standard error for a prediction interval is called the standard error of forecast, and it 
includes the uncertainty associated with the vertical “scatter” about the regression line plus the 
uncertainty associated with the position of the regression line value itself.
