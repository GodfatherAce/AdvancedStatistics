Properties of the regression coefficients:

Types of data and regression model. Assumptions for Model

A. Regression coefficients as random variables. Unbiasedness of the regression coefficients. Precision

of the regression coefficients. Gauss–Markov theorem.

t test of a hypothesis relating to a regression

coefficient. Type I error and Type II error. Confidence intervals. One-sided tests.

F test of goodness of fit.

Multiple regression analysis:

Multiple regression with two explanatory variables. Graphical

representation of a relationship in a multiple regression model. Properties of the multiple regression

coefficients. Population variance of the regression coefficients. Decomposition of their standard errors.
