\subsection{Distribution of Maxima} It is possible to use Order
Statistics theory to assess conditional probabilities. With two
random variables $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$, we define two variables $Z$
and $W$ such that they take the maximum and minimum values of the
pair of $T$ values.\subsection{Plot of the Maxima against the
Minima}


In Figure 1,  The Maximas are plotted against their corresponding
minima. The Critical values of the Maxima and Minima are displayed
in the dotted lines.The Line of Equality depicts the obvious
logical constraint of the each Maximum value being greater than
its corresponding minimum value.
