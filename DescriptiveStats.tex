MA4505 Week 8 

1) Descriptive statistics
2) Histograms
3) Binomial and Poisson distribution

std. dev:s =i=1i=n(x-x)2n-1



The mean (x) 


The square root of the variance is the standard deviation.


Histograms
1) Count the number of observations. The number of intervals (also called "bins") should be approximately the square root of the number of observations.

2) Determine the number of observations in each interval.

3) Draw your histogram.

Binomial distribution

1) Binomial coefficients

nk=n!(n-k)!k!


\[5! = 54321 = 120\]
	
Important 0! = 1

82=8!(8-2)!2!=8!6!2!=876!6!2!=8721= 28
