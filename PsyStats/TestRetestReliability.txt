Test-retest reliability 


Test-retest reliability is a measure of the consistency of a psychological test or assessment. This kind of reliability is used to determine the consistency of a test across time. Test-retest reliability is best used for things that are stable over time, such as intelligence.


Test-retest reliability is measured by administering a test twice at two different points in time. This type of reliability assumes that there will be no change in the quality or construct being measured. In most cases, reliability will be higher when little time has passed between tests.


The test-retest method is just one of the ways that can be used to determine the reliability of a measurement. 


Other techniques that can be used include inter-rater reliablity, internal consistency and parallel-forms reliability.
