\subsection*{Variance-Stabilizing Transformation}
In applied statistics, a variance-stabilizing transformation is a data transformation that is specifically chosen either to simplify considerations in graphical exploratory data analysis or to allow the application of simple regression-based or analysis of variance techniques.[1]
 
The aim behind the choice of a variance-stabilizing transformation is to find a simple function $f$ to apply to values x in a data set to create new values y = Æ’(x) such that the variability of the values y is not related to their mean value.

\subsection*{Anscombe Transformation}
In statistics, the Anscombe transform, named after Francis Anscombe, is a variance-stabilizing transformation that transforms a random variable with a Poisson distribution into one with an approximately standard Gaussian distribution. The Anscombe transform is widely used in photon-limited imaging (astronomy, X-ray) where images naturally follow the Poisson law. The Anscombe transform is usually used to pre-process the data in order to make the standard deviation approximately constant. Then denoising algorithms designed for the framework of additive white Gaussian noise are used; the final 
estimate is then obtained by applying an inverse Anscombe transformation to the denoised data.
